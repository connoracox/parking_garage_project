# parking_garage_project
Connor's fork

Collaboration project between Connor and Abe.

We built the outline for the code structure together. Abe built out take_ticket and payForParking,
While I built out leave_garage. We collaborated on some of the functionality for payForParking as we
kept running into errors for that section and had to do some trial and error.
